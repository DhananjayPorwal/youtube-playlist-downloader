# Welcome to PySimpleGUI 5 !!

Do you use PySimpleGUI 4? [Here is what you need to know.](https://docs.pysimplegui.com/en/latest/readme/sunset/)

**PySimpleGUI creates desktop applications easily**, enhancing the tkinter, Qt, WxPython, and Remi frameworks with a much simpler programming interface:

1. PySimpleGUI user interfaces are defined using core Python data types (lists and dictionaries) that are easily understood by beginners.
2. PySimpleGUI event handling changes from a complex callback-based model to a simpple message passing one.
3. PySimpleGUI uses simple Python code and has no requirement for object oriented architecture.

PySimpleGUI is more than a GUI library: PySimpleGUI simplifies much of your Python development process. Sure, it makes developing user interfaces much easier, but PySimpleGUI also tames advanced Python functionality (such as threading) and makes it easy for all users to take their Python applications to the next level. PySimpleGUI is a robust toolkit.

## Introducing PySimpleGUI 5

For the last 5 years, PySimpleGUI offered free software with the hope of sustaining the
company by donations. We appreciate the support we received, but the amount has been too
small to support the PySimpleGUI project. For this reason, PySimpleGUI is switching to a
subscription model, where commercial users are expected to pay a nominal annual fee.


PySimpleGUI is now part of PySimpleSoft, Inc., whose mission is to make the best Python
application develement environment much, much better. Since launching in 2018, PySimpleGUI
has helped hobbyists and professionals alike create Python GUIs in a fraction of the time.
PySimpleGUI 5 takes PySimpleGUI to the next level, providing hundreds of improvements,
including new features, enhanced security, and priority support.


PySimpleGUI 5 is licensed software. As the [License Agreement](license.txt) explains, after a trial
period, all PySimpleGUI 5 users must register at PySimpleGUI.com to obtain a Developer Key.
For most users (Hobbyist Users), the license is at NO COST. If you are a Commercial User,
subscriptions cost a nominal $99/year.

To get started with a 30-day trial period, first install Python and then

    python -m pip install pysimplegui

and run some code, like

    import PySimpleGUI as sg
    layout = [ [sg.Text('Hello, world!')] ]
    window = sg.Window('Hello Example', layout)
    while True:
        event, values = window.read()
        if event == sg.WIN_CLOSED:
            break
