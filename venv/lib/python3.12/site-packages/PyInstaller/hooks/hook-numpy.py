# NOTE: when comparing the contents of this hook and the NumPy version of the hook (for example, to port changes), keep
# in mind that this copy is PyInstaller-centric - it caters to the version of PyInstaller it is bundled with, but needs
# to account for different behavior of different NumPy versions. In contrast, the NumPy copy of the hook caters to the
# version of NumPy it is bundled with, but should account for behavior differences in different PyInstaller versions.

# Override the default hook priority so that our copy of hook is used instead of NumPy's one (which has priority 0,
# the default for upstream hooks).
