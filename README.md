## Known Errors

If a folder with the same name as the playlist already exists, the script will throw an error. This is because the script tries to create a new folder with an alphanumeric name based on the playlist title to store the downloaded videos. However, if a folder with the same name already exists, the operating system will not allow the creation of another folder with the same name, resulting in an error.

> To resolve this issue, you can either delete the existing folder or rename it before running the script.
