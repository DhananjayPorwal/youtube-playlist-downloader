## Known Errors

### CLI

If a folder with the same name as the playlist already exists, the script will throw an error. This is because the script tries to create a new folder with an alphanumeric name based on the playlist title to store the downloaded videos. However, if a folder with the same name already exists, the operating system will not allow the creation of another folder with the same name, resulting in an error.

> To resolve this issue, you can either delete the existing folder or rename it before running the script.

### GUI

In the GUI version, there might be instances where the program appears to be unresponsive or not updating while it's performing the download process. This can happen because the download process might take some time, especially for larger playlists or when downloading videos with high resolutions.

Please be patient and wait for the program to complete its job. Even if it seems unresponsive, it's still working in the background. Avoid clicking or interacting with the program during the download process to ensure a smooth operation.

Once the download process is finished, the program will display a success message, indicating that all the videos have been successfully downloaded.
